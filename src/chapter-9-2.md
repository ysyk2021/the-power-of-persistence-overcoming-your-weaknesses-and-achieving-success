Once goals are identified, individuals should develop a plan for achieving them. This plan should include specific actions that can be taken to move towards the goal, as well as potential obstacles and strategies for overcoming them. The plan should also include a timeline for achieving the goal and milestones along the way to track progress.

Maintaining Motivation
